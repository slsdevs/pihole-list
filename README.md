```gherkin=
Feature: Shopping Cart
  As a Shopper
  I want to put items in my shopping cart
  Because I want to manage items before I check out

  Scenario: User adds item to cart
    Given I'm a logged-in User
    When I go to the Item page
    And I click "Add item to cart"
    Then the quantity of items in my cart should go up
    And my subtotal should increment
    And the warehouse inventory should decrement
